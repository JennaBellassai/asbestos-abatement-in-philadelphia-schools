# asbestos-abatement-in-philadelphia-schools
Repo for exploring data from the Philadelphia City Controller's school district asbestos dashboard.

This repo contains the Jupyter notebook and data sources used to develop the visualizations in this blog post.

## Background

On November 10, 2021, the Office of the City Controller released [a dashboard](https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-audits/interactive-asbestos-dashboard/#/) displaying asbestos abatement projects in school buildings in the School District of Philadelphia. For more information about the dashboard, see [this press release](https://controller.phila.gov/city-controllers-office-releases-dashboard-on-school-district-asbestos-projects/) from the Office of the Controller and the dashboard's [About page](https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-audits/interactive-asbestos-dashboard/#/about).

The dashboard shows the number of asbestos abatement projects at school buildings in the district since 2016. I was interested to get a more detailed view of the data to answer questions such as:

* What is the total linear (and square) footage of asbestos removed or planned to be removed per school for these projects?
* Do schools with less funding in the district tend to have more linear (and square) footage of asbestos described in these projects?
* Is the number and severity of asbestos abatement projects planned in the district increasing or decreasing over time?
* Do schools that opened in earlier years have more projects or more severe projects?
